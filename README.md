# ArthAlfa Text Analysis and String Replacement App

This is a React-based web application that allows users to perform real-time text analysis and string replacement. The app provides statistics like unique word count and character count (excluding spaces and punctuation) as the user types, along with the functionality to search and replace strings.

## Features

- **Real-Time Statistics**:
  - Unique Word Count: Displays the number of distinct words (case-insensitive).
  - Character Count: Shows the number of characters excluding spaces and punctuation.
  
- **String Replacement**:
  - Users can search for and replace specific strings within the text.
  - Replacement is case-sensitive and applies to all occurrences of the search string.
